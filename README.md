# My Blog Dashboard

A Next.js + Zustand powered blogging dashboard that allows users to create, edit, view, and delete posts with a clean, modern interface. All data is persisted locally using Zustand + localStorage, so your posts remain even after page refresh.

## Features

Dashboard Views: Toggle between Grid/Card view and Table view for posts.

Post Management: Create, edit, and delete blog posts.

Post Details: View full post content, author info, creation date, and tags.

Validation: Robust form validation using Zod.

Persistence: Posts are stored locally with Zustand + localStorage, no backend required.

Responsive UI: Built with a modern component library (cards, alerts, modals, buttons).

Confirmation Dialogs: Delete actions are confirmed to prevent accidental deletion.
